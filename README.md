# security_craft_brutforce

This Script can be used to bypass the key locks from the security craft Minecraft mod.

This should work for all Versions. Tested only for 1.12.2

**Limitations:** You can only brut force up to 10 character. Also the script takes it time so that the mod can keep up.

pip install keyboard
pip install pyautogui
pip install Pillow --upgrade

Please do not play in fullscreen mode! Window mode only. Press F11 to switch. Task bar at the bottom please. If the bar is standart or double size does not matter This will automatically scale to your display.

Also the output of the combination might only be in the area of the true combination.
